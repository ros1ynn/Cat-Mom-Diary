        <h2 class="h2">From the Very Begining</h2>
        <p class="introText">
            Born in Fall 2020 in Tompsontown, Pennsylvania,
            Cuddles and Snuggles are the best friends of each other.<br>
            They would play fights until exhausted then cuddle to dreams.<br>
            When the sisters are 3 months old, their original family started to look for an adoption family for them. <br>
            -- That's how we found Cuddles and Snuggles on Lancaster Puppies.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2">How the Sisters Came into Our Life</h2>
        <p class="introText">
            We only expected one kitten at first, but their original family told us Cuddles and Snuggles have never been apart since they were born.
            So we decided to take both of them home with us. <br>
            On December 3rd, 2020, with all the excitement regardless the cold wind and heavy clouds in winter Pennsylvania,
            we met our twins in the parking lot outside of Weis.<br>
            Our girls were even cuter than their pictures!
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2">The Adventure of Mom and Daughters...Then Began</h2>
        <p class="introText">
            I still could not believe I became a cat mom for my girls all at once!<br>
            Cuddles and Snuggles are the sunshine of my life no matter rain or snow.<br>
            Finally, thanks to Janelle's daughter, the angel who brought me my girls,
            who gave their lovely names and taught them to be good girls for good.<br>
            We will always remember you and may God bless your family &#128151;
